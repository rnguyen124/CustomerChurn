# CustomerChurn

In this project, I am tasked with analyzing a telecoommunications customer dataset that details customer churn and other factors. Customer churn is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. Many factors can contribute to this such as dissatisfaction, better competitors, change in customer needs, and many more. In competitive businesses, retaining customers is critical for survival.

My analysis will explore why customers leave using the data attributes provided. The goal of this analysis is to help identify potential churn risks through data analysis and machine learning. This will enable a company to take proactive steps in customer retention by making data driven recommendations.
